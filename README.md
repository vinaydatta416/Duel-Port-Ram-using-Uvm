# Duel-Port-Ram-using-Uvm
This project involves designing and verifying a **Dual-Port RAM (DPRAM)**, enabling simultaneous read and write operations through two independent ports. The **RTL design**, implemented in **Verilog**, ensures synchronous operation with parameterized data width and memory depth for scalability. A **SystemVerilog UVM-based testbench** is developed to verify functionality using **constrained random stimulus, functional coverage, and assertion-based verification (SVA)**. **Simulation in Mentor QuestaSim** validates read/write operations, simultaneous access scenarios, and data integrity. Optimizations focus on reducing memory access latency and ensuring FPGA/ASIC compatibility. This project demonstrates expertise in **RTL design, UVM-based verification, and simulation methodologies** for high-performance computing and embedded systems.
